- expand games.db to fit columns from external games. make them nullable.

- fix ghastly styling on menus at some point, make it smaller and more verbose.

- migrate all js to typescript (ongoing)

- consider using an sqlite ORM like sequelize


- PRUNE the entire DB. We don't actually need any game information other than user information, you only need the game cover and title + rating, date_added etc. Reduce bloat.
